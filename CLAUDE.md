# CLAUDE.md

This file documents the conventions and architecture rules for the DMS Vehicle Inventory module. Read this before making changes.

## Stack

Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) on Vercel, Supabase for database and auth, Tailwind for styling, Vitest for tests, GitHub Actions for CI.

## Architecture: FE/BE Boundary

Next.js is full-stack — there is no separate backend server or repo. "Frontend/backend separation" here means strict internal import boundaries within one app, not separate deployments.

```
src/
  app/                    # routes, layouts, pages — FRONTEND
    (dashboard)/
    api/                  # route handlers — thin, delegate to server/
  components/             # UI components — FRONTEND
  server/                 # BACKEND: all business logic & data access
    services/             # business logic
    repositories/         # Supabase queries live only here
    actions/               # Server Actions ("use server")
  lib/                      # shared, framework-agnostic helpers (formatting, client-side validation)
    supabase/
      client.ts            # browser client
      server.ts             # server client
  types/                    # shared types
```

**Rules (enforced by ESLint where possible — see `eslint.config.mjs`):**

1. Components and pages (`src/app/**`, `src/components/**`) never import the Supabase client directly. All data access goes through `server/services` or `server/actions`.
2. `server/repositories` is the only layer allowed to call Supabase directly.
3. API routes (`src/app/api/**`) stay thin: validate input, call a service, return a response. No business logic, no direct Supabase/repository imports.

If you hit a lint error from `no-restricted-imports` on a Supabase or repository import, that's the boundary rule working as intended — fix the layering, don't disable the rule.

**Client-side form validation:** forms should validate in real time (on change/blur) and disable their submit button until valid — don't make the user submit to discover errors. Real-time validation is a pure UX layer: put it in a framework-agnostic helper under `src/lib/<domain>-form-validation.ts` (e.g. `vehicle-form-validation.ts`), imported directly by the form component. It must mirror, not replace, the authoritative validation in `server/services` — the service still re-validates independently since the form is never the only caller.

## Database (Supabase)

Schema lives in `supabase/migrations/*.sql`, drafted by the `migration` agent (see `.claude/agents/migration.md`). Every migration must enable RLS with explicit policies before it's done.

### Local development

Requires Docker running.

```bash
npx supabase start   # boots local Postgres/Studio (once per Docker session)
npx supabase db reset # applies every migration in supabase/migrations/, then supabase/seed.sql
```

`supabase/seed.sql` only runs automatically via `db reset` locally — it does **not** run automatically against a remote project.

### Applying a migration to the shared/remote project

The app's runtime already points at the shared project via `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env`, but the Supabase CLI needs its own, separate auth to run schema commands (`link`, `db push`, `db query`) — that's a personal credential, not the app's anon key, and `supabase login`'s browser flow doesn't work non-interactively (e.g. from an agent/CI shell), so use a personal access token instead:

1. Generate one at https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens — each engineer/agent uses their own; never share or commit one.
2. Find the project ref: it's the subdomain in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (`https://<project-ref>.supabase.co`) — not secret, safe to share/document.
3. Link and push:
   ```bash
   export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
   npx supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
   npx supabase db push                                     # applies pending migrations
   npx supabase db query --linked --file supabase/seed.sql  # only if you also want to (re)seed demo data
   ```
   `db push` applies migrations only — there's no remote equivalent of `db reset`'s auto-seed, so seeding a remote project is a deliberate, separate step via `db query --linked --file`.
4. Never put `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in any committed file, including `.env.local` — export it for the session/command only.

Applying a migration or seed to the remote project is never done without the user's explicit confirmation — see `.claude/agents/migration.md`.

## Git Workflow

All feature work — whether done directly or by a subagent — uses standard branching and Conventional Commits. This applies to the `build-feature` and `migration` agents in particular, since they're the ones that write code and schema changes.

**Branches:** create a branch off `main` before starting work, named `<type>/<short-kebab-description>`, e.g. `feat/vehicle-listing-page`, `fix/vehicle-status-filter`, `chore/update-eslint-config`. Never commit feature work directly to `main`.

**Commits:** use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `<type>(<scope>): <description>`, where `<scope>` is optional (e.g. the module/domain, like `vehicles` or `auth`). Common types:

- `feat` — a new feature or capability
- `fix` — a bug fix
- `chore` — tooling, config, dependency, or non-source changes
- `refactor` — code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` — adding or correcting tests
- `docs` — documentation only

Keep commits scoped to one logical change; don't bundle an unrelated fix into a feature commit.

**Pushing:** creating a branch and committing locally doesn't require asking first, but pushing to the remote or opening a PR does — confirm with the user before either, per the harness's default caution around actions visible to others.

## Using the Claude Code Harness

- `/create-module <domain>` — scaffold a new repository + service (+ action/route) for a domain.
- `/review-ui [files]` — check a component/page against the boundary rules above.
- `/generate-tests <file>` — generate Vitest tests for a service/repository/route.
- `build-feature` agent — implements a full vertical slice end-to-end.
- `bug-triage` agent — reproduces a reported bug, isolates the root cause, and implements the minimal fix.
- `code-review` agent — reviews a diff for boundary violations and correctness.
- `migration` agent — drafts Supabase schema migrations (SQL, with RLS).
- `qa` agent — runs a real-browser Playwright smoke check of a feature before it's pushed; the last gate after lint/test/build.
- `scaffold-crud`, `react-form`, `api-endpoint` skills — implementation patterns for CRUD, forms, and API routes respectively.
- `design-system` skill — the visual design system (colors, typography, spacing, radius, motion, components) all UI work in this repo should follow.

These are draft/initial versions written during the foundations phase, before any Vehicle Inventory feature work has started. Expect to refine them as real features are built.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start the dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint (includes the boundary rule)
- `npm run format` / `npm run format:check` — Prettier
- `npm run test` — Vitest
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright (real-browser e2e specs under `e2e/`)
